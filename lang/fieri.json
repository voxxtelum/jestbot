  "Holy moly, Stromboli!",
  "We’re takin’ you on a road rockin’ trip down to Flavortown, where the gravitational force of bacon warps the laws of space and time.",
  "I wake up in the morning thinking about food.",
  "Peace, love and taco grease!",
  "Some people are just born to cook and talk.",
  "You know what, it might just be a mound of oil-logged Pillsbury crescent dough, but it’s bomb-dot-com tasty, amigo.",
  "They make a porchetta that you won’t forgetta.",
  "That deep fryer looks like the community pool in Flavortown.",
  "His seafood is so fresh it’ll slap ya!",
  "What a hot frisbee of fun!",
  "Dude, I’ve been stricken by chicken!",
  "I could put this on a flip-flop and it would taste good.",
  "I can’t play the guitar, but I can play the griddle."
